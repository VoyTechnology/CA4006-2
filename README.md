---

Building
--------

Make the frontend

```sh
make frontend
```

This would place the whole generated frontend in `webapp` directory

> __DO NOT EDIT THE WEBAPP MANUALLY. WORK WITH `main/dart` to update the code

---

Packaging
---------

```sh
make package
```

Make sure to run `make frontend` before building to get the latest version of
the frontend.

---

## Developing

The frontend can be served in realtime by running `make serve`. This will use
the stubbed server and will not actually do anything.

You need Dart version `>=1.24` and `< 2.0.0`

You can also package the full application and run it in local instance of Tomcat
in docker:

```sh
make docker-run
```

This will also use the latest version of the frontend.

Please make sure to build and push the whole new frontend on each push. The
files are marked as autogenerated so they should not show in the diff.
